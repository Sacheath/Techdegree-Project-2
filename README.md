# Basketball Team Stats Tool
In this project you will be writing a program that reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py`. 
This data will need to be translated into a new collection of your choosing and the fields need to be changed to something that makes more sense for Python to do its comparisons.

# This program will allow you to view a list of teams, its players, and its various stats.

Instructions

1) Create a new script

2) Proper use of Dunder Main

3) Import player and team data

4) Create a clean_data function

5) Create a balance_teams function

6) Console readability matters

7) Displaying the stats
	Team's name as a string
	Total players on that team as an integer
	The player names as strings separated by commas
	Number of inexperienced players on that team
	Number of experienced players on that team
	The average height of the team
	The guardians of all the players on that team (as a comma-separated string)
	
Extra Credit

2) Quit Menu Option

3) Organize Players by Height
